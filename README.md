This API is written in NodeJS, i originally made this because i have a small hosting bussiness (https://serverhouse.pro) and i needed a bot that can interact with my panel. The only library that exists for it is for JDA (One might exist for python or other languages but idk). 

While this was originally meant to work with Discord.js, it will work with any of NodeJS librarys, such as socket.io and more!.
